# Product Overview

This is a web-based circuit analysis application for electrical engineering education and professional use. The application enables users to:

- Visually design DC electrical circuits using drag-and-drop components (resistors, voltage sources, current sources)
- Automatically perform nodal analysis (cut-set method) and loop analysis (tie-set method)
- View step-by-step mathematical solutions with properly formatted matrices and equations
- Manage multiple circuit designs in a single session

## Key Features

- Three-pane interface: circuit manager (left), visual editor (center), analysis results (right)
- Real-time circuit validation with clear error messages
- Professional-grade mathematical analysis using graph theory and matrix methods
- LaTeX/KaTeX rendering for equations and matrices
- Centralized state management for data consistency

## Target Users

Students and professionals working with DC circuit analysis who need to understand both the circuit design and the underlying mathematical solution process.
