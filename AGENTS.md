# Cursor IDE Rules for Bun Package Manager

## Package Manager Configuration

- Always use Bun as the package manager instead of npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Use the specific Bun binary path: ~/.bun/bin/bun
- When installing packages, use: ~/.bun/bin/bun install
- When adding packages, use: ~/.bun/bin/bun add <package-name>
- When removing packages, use: ~/.bun/bin/bun remove <package-name>
- When running scripts, use: ~/.bun/bin/bun run <script-name>
- When executing files directly, use: ~/.bun/bin/bun <file-path>

## Scripts and Commands

- Prefer Bun's built-in commands over npm equivalents
- Use `~/.bun/bin/bun create` for scaffolding new projects
- Use `~/.bun/bin/bun test` for running tests
- Use `~/.bun/bin/bun build` for building projects

## File Operations

- When creating package.json files, ensure they're compatible with Bun
- When suggesting package installations, always use Bun syntax
- When providing terminal commands, use the full path to Bun binary

## Development Workflow

- Always assume Bun is the preferred runtime and package manager
- Suggest Bun-specific optimizations and features when relevant
- Use Bun's faster installation and execution capabilities

## Code Quality Checks

**IMPORTANT: Check in this exact order:**

1. **CodeScene Diagnostics (FIRST)** - After making any code modifications, ALWAYS check CodeScene diagnostics FIRST using `getDiagnostics` tool
   - Check for: Code Duplication, Bumpy Road Ahead, Complex Method, Large Method, Primitive Obsession
   - Fix ALL CodeScene warnings before proceeding to linting
   - Refactor code to eliminate all warnings (see code-quality.md steering for patterns)
   - Re-check diagnostics after refactoring to ensure all issues are resolved

2. **TypeScript Compilation (SECOND)** - After CodeScene diagnostics are clean, run `~/.bun/bin/bun tsgo` to check for TypeScript compilation errors
   - Fix any type errors
   - Ensure strict type checking passes

3. **Linting (THIRD)** - After TypeScript compilation passes, run `~/.bun/bin/bun lint` to check for linting issues
   - Fix any ESLint errors
   - Address any code style violations

4. **CodeScene Analysis (FOURTH)** - After linting passes, run `~/.bun/bin/bun codescene` to perform code quality analysis
   - Check for code health issues
   - Verify all metrics meet full health thresholds
   - Address any remaining quality concerns

5. **SonarCloud Scan (FIFTH)** - After CodeScene analysis passes, run `~/.bun/bin/bun sonar-scan` to perform final static analysis
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
   - Verify code coverage and quality gates
   - Address any critical or blocker issues

**Workflow:**

```
Code Changes → CodeScene Diagnostics → TypeScript Check → Linting → CodeScene Analysis → SonarCloud Scan → Task Complete
     ↓              ↓ (if warnings)         ↓ (if errors)    ↓ (if errors)    ↓ (if issues)        ↓ (if issues)
  Refactor ←────────┘                       │                │                │                     │
  Fix Types ←───────────────────────────────┘                │                │                     │
  Fix Style ←────────────────────────────────────────────────┘                │                     │
  Refactor ←──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘                     │
  Fix Issues ←───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Fix any issues found at each step before moving to the next step
- If CodeScene diagnostics show warnings, address them immediately and re-check
- These checks should be run automatically after any file modifications or code changes
- NEVER skip CodeScene diagnostics - they catch architectural issues that linting misses

## Code Style Rules

- **No nested ternary operators** - SonarJS will flag them as code smells
- Extract nested ternaries into if/else statements or separate functions

## Commit Message Rules

- Write concise, descriptive commit messages that clearly explain what was changed
- Focus on the actual changes made, not on compliance statements
- NEVER include repetitive endings like "- Ensured all changes comply with Bun package manager rules and maintain code quality standards."
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adding feature")

## Logging

- **NEVER use `console` methods directly** - ESLint will error
- **Always use the logger utility**: `import { logger } from '@/utils/logger'`
- Logger methods require a `caller` option to identify the source: `logger.info({ caller: "MyComponent" }, "Message", data)`
- Logger only works in development mode (`import.meta.env.DEV`)
- Logs are batched every 2 seconds and sent to `/api/logs`
- Log files are written to `logs/client_[sessionId].log` with sequence numbers
- Use descriptive caller names (component/function name) for easy debugging

## Translation System

### Creating New Translation Component (6 steps):

1. Create type in `client/locale/components/MyFeature.ts` with `[key: string]: string;` as first property
2. Export from `client/locale/components/index.ts`: `export * from "./MyFeature";`
3. Create AR translation in `client/locale/ar/myFeature.ts`: `export const myFeature: MyFeatureTranslations = {...}`
4. Create EN translation in `client/locale/en/enMyFeature.ts`: `export const enMyFeature: MyFeatureTranslations = {...}`
5. Export from `client/locale/ar/index.ts` and `client/locale/en/index.ts`
6. Register in `client/locale/translations.ts`: Add to `Translations` type, `ar` object (use `AR.myFeature`), and `en` object (use `EN.enMyFeature`)

### Using Translations:

- Import: `import { useAppTranslation } from "@/client/locale";`
- Use hook: `const {myFeatureTranslations: strings} = useAppTranslation();`
- Access: `{strings.title}`, `{strings.submitButton}` - NO fallbacks like `{strings.title || "Fallback"}`
- NEVER use hardcoded strings for user-facing text
- NEVER use fallback strings (e.g., `|| "Default"`, `?? "Fallback"`)
- Can use multiple namespaces: `const {errorTranslations: errorStrings} = useAppTranslation();`
- Naming: AR files are camelCase (e.g., `myFeature.ts`), EN files have `en` prefix (e.g., `enMyFeature.ts`)
