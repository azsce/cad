Here is a summary of the algorithms, instructions, and useful information from the `CAD\_Lec\_03.pdf` file.



\## Useful Information



\### General Branch Model

\* A general network branch can be represented by a voltage source ($E\_B$) and an impedance ($Z\_B$) in series, which are in parallel with a current source ($I\_B$).

\* The total current flowing in the branch is $J\_B$.

\* The total voltage across the branch is $V\_B$.



\### Branch Equilibrium Equations

There are two primary ways to relate the branch voltage ($V\_B$) and branch current ($J\_B$):



1\.  \*\*Impedance Form (Voltage-Current Relation):\*\*

&nbsp;   \* $V\_B = (J\_B + I\_B)Z\_B - E\_B$

&nbsp;   \* In matrix form for a whole network:

&nbsp;       $V\_B = Z\_B(J\_B + I\_B) - E\_B$

&nbsp;   \* Where $V\_B$, $J\_B$, $I\_B$, and $E\_B$ are $B \\times 1$ vectors (B = number of branches).

&nbsp;   \* $Z\_B$ is the $B \\times B$ diagonal branch impedance matrix.



2\.  \*\*Admittance Form (Current-Voltage Relation):\*\*

&nbsp;   \* $J\_B = Y\_B(V\_B + E\_B) - I\_B$

&nbsp;   \* In matrix form for a whole network:

&nbsp;       $J\_B = Y\_B V\_B + Y\_B E\_B - I\_B$

&nbsp;   \* $Y\_B$ is the $B \\times B$ diagonal branch admittance matrix.

\## Algorithm 1: Loop (Tie-Set) Analysis



This algorithm solves for the unknown loop currents ($I\_L$).



1\.  \*\*KVL (Kirchhoff's Voltage Law):\*\* Start with the KVL equation, which states that the sum of branch voltages ($V\_B$) around any loop is zero. This is expressed using the tie-set matrix ($B$):

&nbsp;   \* $B V\_B = 0$



2\.  \*\*Loop Transformation:\*\* Define the relationship between branch currents ($J\_B$) and loop currents ($I\_L$) using the transpose of the tie-set matrix:

&nbsp;   \* $J\_B = B^T I\_L$



3\.  \*\*Substitution (Step 1):\*\* Substitute the branch impedance equation ($V\_B = Z\_B(J\_B + I\_B) - E\_B$) into the KVL equation ($B V\_B = 0$):

&nbsp;   \* $B \[Z\_B(J\_B + I\_B) - E\_B] = 0$

&nbsp;   \* This simplifies to: $B Z\_B (J\_B + I\_B) - B E\_B = 0$



4\.  \*\*Substitution (Step 2):\*\* Substitute the loop transformation equation ($J\_B = B^T I\_L$) into the result from Step 3:

&nbsp;   \* $B Z\_B (B^T I\_L + I\_B) - B E\_B = 0$

&nbsp;   \* Distribute the terms: $B Z\_B B^T I\_L + B Z\_B I\_B - B E\_B = 0$



5\.  \*\*Final Equation:\*\* Rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown loop currents ($I\_L$):

&nbsp;   \* \*\*$B Z\_B B^T I\_L = B E\_B - B Z\_B I\_B$\*\*

&nbsp;   \* This is the final system of linear equations to be solved.

\## Algorithm 2: Nodal (Cut-Set) Analysis



This algorithm solves for the unknown node voltages ($E\_N$).



1\.  \*\*KCL (Kirchhoff's Current Law):\*\* Start with the KCL equation, which states that the sum of branch currents ($J\_B$) at any node is zero. This is expressed using the cut-set matrix ($C$):

&nbsp;   \* $C J\_B = 0$



2\.  \*\*Nodal Transformation:\*\* Define the relationship between branch voltages ($V\_B$) and node-pair voltages ($E\_N$) using the transpose of the cut-set matrix:

&nbsp;   \* $V\_B = C^T E\_N$



3\.  \*\*Substitution (Step 1):\*\* Substitute the branch admittance equation ($J\_B = Y\_B V\_B + Y\_B E\_B - I\_B$) into the KCL equation ($C J\_B = 0$):

&nbsp;   \* $C \[Y\_B V\_B + Y\_B E\_B - I\_B] = 0$

&nbsp;   \* This simplifies to: $C Y\_B V\_B + C Y\_B E\_B - C I\_B = 0$



4\.  \*\*Substitution (Step 2):\*\* Substitute the nodal transformation equation ($V\_B = C^T E\_N$) into the result from Step 3:

&nbsp;   \* $C Y\_B (C^T E\_N) + C Y\_B E\_B - C I\_B = 0$



5\.  \*\*Final Equation:\*\* Rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown node voltages ($E\_N$):

&nbsp;   \* \*\*$C Y\_B C^T E\_N = C (I\_B - Y\_B E\_B)$\*\*

&nbsp;   \* This is the final system of linear equations to be solved.
