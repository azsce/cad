Here is a summary of the algorithms, instructions, and useful information from the `CAD\_Lec\_01.pdf` file.



\## 1. Graph Theory Concepts



\### Definitions

\* \*\*Graph Theory\*\*: A graphical representation of electric circuits used for analysis.

\* \*\*Node\*\*: A common point where two or more branches meet.

\* \*\*Branch\*\*: A line segment that connects two nodes.



\### Types of Graphs

\* \*\*Connected vs. Unconnected\*\*:

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Connected\*\*: A graph where at least one branch or path exists between any two nodes.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Unconnected\*\*: A graph where at least one node is not connected by any branch.

\* \*\*Directed vs. Undirected\*\*:

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Directed (Oriented)\*\*: A graph where all branches are represented with arrows.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Undirected (Unoriented)\*\*: A graph where branches are not represented with arrows.



\### Subgraphs (Tree and Co-Tree)

\* \*\*Subgraph\*\*: A part of a graph, created by removing some nodes and/or branches.

\* \*\*Tree\*\*:

&nbsp;   \* A connected subgraph that contains all nodes of the original graph.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Properties\*\*:

&nbsp;       1.  Must contain all nodes of the graph.

&nbsp;       2.  Must form a connected subgraph.

&nbsp;       3.  Must \*\*not\*\* contain any loops.

\* \*\*Tree Branch (Twig)\*\*: Any branch that is part of the tree.

\* \*\*Tree Link (Link)\*\*: Any branch from the original graph that is \*not\* part of the tree.

\* \*\*Co-Tree\*\*: A subgraph formed by the branches that were removed to create the tree (i.e., the links).

\## 2. Algorithms and Instructions



\### How to Convert an Electric Circuit to a Graph



> 1.  Identify all principal nodes in the circuit.

> 2.  Replace all \*\*passive elements\*\* (like resistors) and \*\*voltage sources\*\* with \*\*short circuits\*\* (lines).

> 3.  Replace all \*\*current sources\*\* with \*\*open circuits\*\* (remove them).

> 4.  The resulting structure of nodes and connecting lines is the equivalent graph.



\### How to Construct an Incidence Matrix (A)



> The Incidence Matrix shows the connection of branches to nodes.

>

> 1.  Create a matrix where rows are the nodes and columns are the branches.

> 2.  For each element `A\[node, branch]`, assign a value:

>     \* \*\*+1\*\*: If the branch current is \*\*leaving\*\* the selected node.

>     \* \*\*-1\*\*: If the branch current is \*\*entering\*\* the selected node.

>     \* \*\*0\*\*: If the branch is not connected to the node.



\### How to Construct a Fundamental Loop (Tie-set) Matrix (B)



> A fundamental loop (f-loop) is a loop containing \*\*only one link\*\* and one or more tree branches. The number of f-loops equals the number of links.

>

> 1.  Create a matrix where rows are the f-loops (one for each link) and columns are all the branches.

> 2.  For each row (representing one f-loop):

>     \* Assign \*\*+1\*\* to the element corresponding to the \*\*link\*\* that defines that f-loop.

>     \* If a \*\*tree branch\*\* in the loop has the \*\*same direction\*\* as the f-loop's link, assign \*\*+1\*\*.

>     \* If a \*\*tree branch\*\* in the loop has the \*\*opposite direction\*\* to the f-loop's link, assign \*\*-1\*\*.

>     \* Assign \*\*0\*\* to all other branches and links that are not part of this specific f-loop.



\### How to Construct a Fundamental Cut-set Matrix (C)



> A fundamental cut-set (f-cut set) is a cut that contains \*\*only one tree branch\*\* and one or more links. \*(Note: The slide text contains some confusing/contradictory definitions, but the example follows this principle).\*

>

> The rules given are:

>

> 1.  Create a matrix where rows are the f-cut sets (one for each tree branch) and columns are all the branches.

> 2.  For each row (representing one f-cut set):

>     \* Assign \*\*+1\*\* "for the link of the selected f-cut set". \*(Note: This appears to be a typo in the slide; the example places a +1 for the \*\*tree branch\*\* that defines the cut-set).\*

>     \* If the direction of a \*\*link's current\*\* in the cut-set is the \*\*same\*\* as the f-cut set's defining \*\*branch current\*\*, assign \*\*+1\*\*.

>     \* If the direction of a \*\*link's current\*\* in the cut-set is \*\*opposite\*\* to the f-cut set's defining \*\*twig current\*\*, assign \*\*-1\*\*.

>     \* Assign \*\*0\*\* to all other branches and links not part of the selected f-cut set.

\## 3. Useful Information and Formulas



\* \*\*CAD (Computer-Aided Design)\*\*: The use of computer systems to help in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design.

\* \*\*CAD Fields\*\*: Includes Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and Mechanical Design Automation (MDA).

\* \*\*Network Topology Matrices\*\*:

&nbsp;   \* They completely describe the interconnections and reference directions of branches.

&nbsp;   \* They allow KCL and KVL laws to be expressed compactly for computers.

\* \*\*Formula for Number of Links\*\*:

&nbsp;   \* `Number of links = B - (N - 1) = B - N + 1`

&nbsp;   \* Where `B` = total number of branches

&nbsp;   \* And `N` = total number of nodes
