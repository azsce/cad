## What is CAD

- **Definition**: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computer systems to assist in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design.
- **Purpose**:
  - Increase the productivity of the designer.
  - Improve the quality of design.
  - Improve communications through documentation.
  - Create a database for manufacturing.
- **Output**: Often in the form of electronic files for print, machining, or other manufacturing operations.

## CAD Fields

- Computer-aided design is used in many fields.
- **Electronic Design Automation (EDA)**: Its use in electronic design.
- **Mechanical Design Automation (MDA)**: Its use in mechanical design.
- **Computer-Aided Drafting**: Describes the process of creating a technical drawing with the use of computer software.

## Graph Theory

It is a graphical representation of electric circuits. It is useful for analyzing complex electric circuits by converting them into network graphs.

### Definitions

- **Graph**: Consists of a set of nodes connected by branches.
- **Node**: A common point of two or more branches. Sometimes, only a single branch may connect to the node.
- **Branch**: A line segment that connects two nodes.

### Example

Let us consider the following **electric circuit**.

- **Four principal nodes** (labelled 1, 2, 3, and 4).
- **Seven branches**:
  - One branch contains a voltage source.
  - One branch contains a current source.
  - The remaining five branches contain resistors.

**Conversion to Equivalent Graph**:

- Any electric circuit or network can be converted into its equivalent **graph** by replacing the passive elements and voltage sources with short circuits and the current sources with open circuits.
- **Observation from Example**: In the provided visual example, the current source (4 A) is replaced by an open circuit (removed), and the voltage source (20 V) is replaced by a short circuit (line). The resulting graph has **6 branches** (labeled a, b, c, d, e, f) corresponding to the 5 resistors and 1 voltage source.

## Types of Graphs

- Connected and Unconnected graph
- Directed and Undirected graph

### Connected and Unconnected graph

- **Connected Graph**: If there exists at least one branch between any of the two nodes of a graph, then it is called as a **connected graph** (if any two nodes of the graph are connected by a path).
- **Unconnected Graph**: If there exists at least one node in the graph that remains unconnected by even single branch, then it is called as an **unconnected graph**.
  - _Visual Example_: The slide shows a graph where node 1 is isolated, while nodes 2, 3, and 4 form a connected triangle.

### Directed and Undirected graph

- **Directed Graph (Oriented Graph)**: If all the branches of a graph are represented with arrows, then that graph is called as a **directed graph**. Also called as **oriented graph**.
- **Undirected Graph (Unoriented Graph)**: If the branches of a graph are not represented with arrows, then that graph is called as an **undirected graph**. Also called as an **unoriented graph**.

## Subgraph and its Types

- A part of the graph is called as a **subgraph**.
- We get subgraphs by removing some nodes and/or branches of a given graph.
- There are the **two types** of subgraphs:
  - Tree
  - Co Tree

### Tree

- A connected subgraph that contains all nodes of the original graph.
- **Properties**:
  1. Must contain all nodes of the graph.
  2. Must form a connected subgraph.
  3. Must **not** contain any loops.
- **Tree Branch (Twig)**: Any branch that is part of the tree.

### Co-Tree

- **Tree Link (Link)**: Any branch from the original graph that is _not_ part of the tree.
- **Co-Tree**: A subgraph formed by the branches that were removed to create the tree (i.e., the links).

## Algorithms and Instructions

### How to Convert an Electric Circuit to a Graph

> 1.  Identify all principal nodes in the circuit.
> 2.  Replace all **passive elements** (like resistors) and **voltage sources** with **short circuits** (lines).
> 3.  Replace all **current sources** with **open circuits** (remove them).
> 4.  The resulting structure of nodes and connecting lines is the equivalent graph.

### How to Construct an Incidence Matrix (A)

> The Incidence Matrix shows the connection of branches to nodes.
>
> 1.  Create a matrix where rows are the nodes and columns are the branches.
> 2.  For each element `A[node, branch]`, assign a value:
>     - **+1**: If the branch current is **leaving** the selected node.
>     - **-1**: If the branch current is **entering** the selected node.
>     - **0**: If the branch is not connected to the node.

#### Incidence Matrix Example

Consider the following **directed graph**:

- **Nodes**: 1, 2, 3, 4
- **Branches**: a, b, c, d, e, f
- **Directions**: a (3->1), b (1->2), c (2->3), d (4->1), e (2->4), f (3->4)

**Incidence Matrix (A)**:

|       | a   | b   | c   | d   | e   | f   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | -1  | 1   | 0   | -1  | 0   | 0   |
| **2** | 0   | -1  | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| **3** | 1   | 0   | -1  | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| **4** | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | -1  | -1  |

### How to Construct a Fundamental Loop (Tie-set) Matrix (B)

> A fundamental loop (f-loop) is a loop containing **only one link** and one or more tree branches. The number of f-loops equals the number of links. This matrix gives the relation between branch currents and link currents.
>
> 1.  Create a matrix where rows are the f-loops (one for each link) and columns are all the branches.
> 2.  For each row (representing one f-loop):
>     - Assign **+1** to the element corresponding to the **link** that defines that f-loop.
>     - If a **tree branch** in the loop has the **same direction** as the f-loop's link, assign **+1**.
>     - If a **tree branch** in the loop has the **opposite direction** to the f-loop's link, assign **-1**.
>     - Assign **0** to all other branches and links that are not part of this specific f-loop.

#### Tie-set Matrix Example

Consider the following **Tree of directed graph**:

- **Tree Branches (Twigs)**: d, e, f (Solid lines)
- **Links**: a, b, c (Dotted lines)

**f-loops**:

- **f-loop 1**: Link a. Loop path: 3->1->4->3. Branches: a, d, f.
- **f-loop 2**: Link b. Loop path: 1->2->4->1. Branches: b, e, d.
- **f-loop 3**: Link c. Loop path: 2->3->4->2. Branches: c, f, e.

**Tie-set Matrix (B)**:
(Columns: d, e, f, a, b, c)

|       | d   | e   | f   | a   | b   | c   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **a** | -1  | 0   | -1  | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| **b** | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| **c** | 0   | -1  | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   |

### How to Construct a Fundamental Cut-set Matrix (C)

> Fundamental cut set or **f-cut set** is the minimum number of branches that are removed from a graph in such a way that the original graph will become two isolated subgraphs.
>
> The f-cut set contains only **one branch** and one or more links. This matrix gives the relation between branch voltages and twig voltages. _(Note: The slide text contains some confusing/contradictory definitions, but the example follows this principle)._
>
> The rules given are:
>
> 1.  Create a matrix where rows are the f-cut sets (one for each tree branch) and columns are all the branches.
> 2.  For each row (representing one f-cut set):
>     - Assign **+1** "for the link of the selected f-cut set". _(Note: This appears to be a typo in the slide; the example places a +1 for the **tree branch** that defines the cut-set)._
>     - If the direction of a **link's current** in the cut-set is the **same** as the f-cut set's defining **branch current**, assign **+1**.
>     - If the direction of a **link's current** in the cut-set is **opposite** to the f-cut set's defining **twig current**, assign **-1**.
>     - Assign **0** to all other branches and links not part of the selected f-cut set.

#### Cut-set Matrix Example

Consider the following **Tree of directed graph**:

- **Tree Branches (Twigs)**: d, e, f (Solid lines)
- **Links**: a, b, c (Dashed lines)

**f-cut sets**:

- **f-cut set 1**: Tree branch d. Cuts branches d, a, b.
- **f-cut set 2**: Tree branch e. Cuts branches e, b, c.
- **f-cut set 3**: Tree branch f. Cuts branches f, a, c.

**Cut-set Matrix (C)**:
(Columns: d, e, f, a, b, c)

|       | d   | e   | f   | a   | b   | c   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **d** | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | -1  | 0   |
| **e** | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | -1  | 1   |
| **f** | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | -1  |

> **Note**: The columns corresponding to the tree branches (d, e, f) form a **Unit matrix**.

## Useful Information and Formulas

- **Formula for Number of Links**:
  - `Number of links = B - (N - 1) = B - N + 1`
  - Where `B` = total number of branches
  - And `N` = total number of nodes
