### Reduced Incidence Matrix

- Any node in a connected graph can be chosen as a **reference node**.

- The voltages of all other nodes (referred to as buses) are then measured with respect to this reference node.

- The row corresponding to this reference node is removed from the full incidence matrix to create the **reduced incidence matrix (A)**.

### Relation between Network Topology Matrices

The following formulas describe the relationships between the different network matrices:

- $C_{L} = -B_{T}^{t}$

- $C_{L} = A_{T}^{-1} * A_{L}$

- $C = A_{T}^{-1} * A$

## Algorithms and Instructions

### How to Apply KCL (Kirchhoff's Current Law)

- You can apply KCL using the **incidence matrix (A)**.

- The matrix equation is: **$A * J_B = 0$**
  - Where **A** is the reduced incidence matrix.

  - Where **$J_B$** is the vector of branch currents.

- Multiplying these matrices yields the set of KCL equations for the non-reference nodes.

- **Example from slide:**
  (Note: In this example, $J_B = [j_a, j_b, j_c, j_d, j_e, j_f]^T$)
  - $-j_a + j_b - j_d = 0$

  - $-j_b + j_c + j_e = 0$

  - $j_a - j_c - j_f = 0$

### How to Apply KVL (Kirchhoff's Voltage Law)

- You can apply KVL using the **tie-set matrix (B)**.

- The matrix equation is: **$B * V_B = 0$**
  - Where **B** is the tie-set matrix.

  - Where **$V_B$** is the vector of branch voltages.

- Multiplying these matrices yields the set of KVL equations for the fundamental loops.

- **Example from slide:**
  (Note: In this example, the matrix columns and vector $V_B$ are ordered as $d, e, f, a, b, c$)
  - $-v_d - v_f + v_a = 0$

  - $v_d + v_e + v_b = 0$

  - $-v_e + v_f + v_c = 0$

### How to Find Branch Currents from Loop Currents

- You can express the branch currents in terms of the loop currents.

- The formula is: **$J_B = B^T * I_L$**
  - Where **$J_B$** is the vector of branch currents.

  - Where **$B^T$** is the transpose of the tie-set matrix.

  - Where **$I_L$** is the vector of loop currents.

### Example

From A matrix calculate the B and C matrices and verify your answer by mean of obtained graph

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
