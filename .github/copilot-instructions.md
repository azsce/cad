## ⛔ STRICT CODE MODIFICATION POLICY ⛔

**ABSOLUTELY NO CODE MODIFICATIONS WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL**

You are **PROHIBITED** from using any file editing tools (`insert_edit_into_file`, `replace_string_in_file`, `edit_notebook_file`, `create_file`) without the user's explicit written permission.

## Before Making Any Code Changes

**MANDATORY PROCESS** - You must ALWAYS follow these steps:

1. **Issue/Problem/Requirements**: Clearly describe what needs to be addressed or implemented
2. **Existing Implementation**: Explain the current state of the code and how it works (if applicable)
3. **Proposed Plan**: Detail your planned approach to solve the issue, including:
   - Which files will be modified
   - What changes will be made to each file
   - What the exact changes will be (show code snippets if helpful)
   - Any potential side effects or risks
   - Alternative approaches considered (if any)

4. **STOP AND WAIT**: After presenting the plan, you MUST explicitly ask: "Do you approve these changes? Should I proceed?"

5. **Only after receiving explicit approval** (e.g., "yes", "approved", "go ahead", "proceed") may you use file editing tools.

## What You CAN Do Without Permission

- Read files
- Search the codebase
- Analyze code
- Answer questions
- Provide explanations
- Show code examples in chat (without modifying files)
- Run terminal commands for information gathering (ls, grep, etc.)

## What You CANNOT Do Without Permission

- Create new files
- Modify existing files
- Delete code
- Refactor code
- Run build/installation commands that modify the project

**REMEMBER**: When in doubt, ask first. Never assume permission.
